## Incident Response Process

In case an incident is discovered or reported, we will follow the following
process to contain, respond and remediate:

### 1. Containment

The first step is to find out the root cause, nature and scope of the incident.

- Is still ongoing? If yes, first priority is to stop it.
- Is the incident outside of our influence? If yes, first priority is to contain it.
- Find out knows about the incident and who is affected.
- Find out what data was potentially exposed.

### 2. Response

After the initial assessment and containment to our best abilities, we will
document all actions taken in a response plan.

### 3. Remediation

Once the incident is confirmed to be resolved, we will summarize the lessons
learned from the incident and create a list of actions we will take to prevent
it from happening again.
